        <h2>1.Water management(Water flow meter)</h2>
        <p >Water is very important for our life.In our day to day life we waste so much of water unconsiously.So for knowing how much water we should use and how much we waste and for taking care of wastage of water I thought to make water flow meter.This will give you data about how much water we are using.I made one prototype by using ultrasonic sensor,arduino and LCD display.By mathematically, I got proportionality of velocity of water which you can see in below diagram.From velocity and time we can easily get amount of water but this was for constant velocity of water source. </p>
